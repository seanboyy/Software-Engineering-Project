INSTALL.txt - Software Engineering

To build/run: finding the .exe
If you have found this document, you are in the root folder.
The path to the .exe is as follows
	- root (Software-Engineering-Project)
	- SoftwareEngineeringProject
	- bin
	- debug
	- SoftwareEngineeringProject.exe
To run, double click the .exe file.

Changes:
	- instead of individual add buttons, there is one button that uses the selection from the list box
	- instead of individual remove buttons, there are 2 (on search and calendar tabs) that remove based on user selection
	- removed collapsible calendar functionality
	- added AM/PM drop downs to avoid ambiguity for time filter
	- also changed time filter drop down to user-inputted times, to allow for class time discrepancies 
	
Everything else in our sprint breakdown works as expected.
